/*get to know the table, what are column names?*/
SELECT * 
FROM nomnom;
/*ANS: name, neighborhood, cuisine, review, price, health*/

/*What are the Distinct Neighborhoods*/
SELECT DISTINCT neighborhood
FROM nomnom;
/*ANS: Brooklyn, Midtown, Chinatown, Uptown, Queens, Downtown*/

/*What are the distinct cuisine types?*/
SELECT DISTINCT cuisine
FROM nomnom;
/*ANS: Steak, Korean, Chinese, Pizza, Ethiopian, Vegetarian, 
Italian, Japanese, American, Mediterranean, Indian, Soul Food,
Mexican*/

/*options for all Chinese Takeout*/
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Chinese';
/*ANS: maybe manually recording entire tables is not the best
option here...*/

/*Return all restraurants with review >= 4*/
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE review >= 4;

/*Return all restaurants with cuisine = 'Italian' and price '$$$'*/
SELECT * 
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Italian' 
AND price = '$$$';

/*Return all restaurants with cuisine = 'Italian' and price >='$$$'*/
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Italian'
AND price LIKE '$$$%';

/*Look for restaurant with "meatball" in name*/
SELECT name
FROM nomnom
WHERE name LIKE '%meatball%';

/*Find close spots in Midtown, Downtown, or Chinatown*/
SELECT * 
FROM nomnom
WHERE neighborhood = 'Midtown' 
OR neighborhood = 'Downtown'
OR neighborhood = 'Chinatown'
ORDER BY neighborhood;

/*Find all health grade pending (NULL) restaurants*/
SELECT * 
FROM nomnom
WHERE health IS NULL;

/*Create a top 10 ranking based on reviews*/
SELECT * 
FROM nomnom 
ORDER BY review DESC
LIMIT 10;

/*Use CASE to change rating system*/

  SELECT name,
   CASE
     WHEN review > 4.5 THEN 'Extraordinary'
    WHEN review > 4 THEN 'Excellent'
     WHEN review > 3 THEN 'Good'
     WHEN review > 2 THEN 'Fair'
    Else 'Poor'
  END AS 'Review'
  FROM nomnom
/*Interesting, SQL executes from L->R and T->B, so if 'fair'
had been higher up it is the first condition filled, and the case
ends there before evaluating case for 'Excellent'. Makes sense.
the AS statement is just a pointer assigning a name, and is not a 
new column in nomnom. it is temporary.*/
