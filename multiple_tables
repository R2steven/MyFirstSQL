practice what we learned about joins by combining rows from different tables. Use some data from a comany like lyft, given three tables:
trips: trips information
riders: user data
cars: autonomous cars
*************************************************************************/


/*examine the three tables*//*
SELECT * FROM trips;

SELECT * FROM riders;
 
SELECT * FROM cars;

/*try a simple cross join between riders and cars*//*
SELECT riders.*, cars.*
FROM riders
CROSS JOIN cars

/*we want to create a trip log with trips and users*//*

SELECT *
FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;

/*we want to create a link between the trips and the cars used during those trips.*//*
SELECT trips.date, trips.type, trips.rider_id, cars.*
FROM trips
JOIN cars
  ON trips.car_id = cars.id;

/*theres a new table, riders2. stack the riders table on top of riders2*//*
SELECT *
FROM riders
UNION 
SELECT * 
FROM riders2;

/*what is the avg cost for a trip?*//*
SELECT ROUND(AVG(cost), 2)
FROM trips;

/*find users who have used lyft <500 times*//*
SELECT *
FROM riders
WHERE total_trips < 500;

/*count how many cars are active*//*
SELECT * 
FROM cars
WHERE status = 'active'

/*find two cars that have the highest trips completed*//*
SELECT * 
FROM cars
ORDER BY trips_completed DESC
LIMIT 2;
